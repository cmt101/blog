This project is meant to be a basic Restful API to demonstrate proficiency with Spring.

To run this project locally, rename the .env.example file to .env, and fill in the parameters.

The JWT secret must be 32 bytes long and can be generated by running "openssl rand -base64 32".


Included is a ddl script to set up the full db schema and a PostMan collection to test the various endpoints.

All endpoints except POST /users, GET /blog/**, and POST /auth/login require a 
Bearer token to be passed in the Authorization header.
